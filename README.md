# 8085-Simulator-Project
8085 Microprocessor SimulatorA high-performance, modular emulator for the Intel 8085 Microprocessor, developed in Java using the Swing framework. This project provides a complete environment to write, assemble, and execute 8085 Assembly language, offering a deep look into internal CPU operations.

Key FeaturesIntegrated Assembly Parser: A custom AssemblyParser.java that converts standard mnemonics (like MOV, ADD, LDA) into executable machine code. Live Register Tracking: Real-time monitoring of all primary registers: Accumulator (A), B, C, D, E, H, L, Program Counter (PC), and Stack Pointer (SP). Status Flag Visualization: Detailed display of the condition code register, tracking Sign (S), Zero (Z), Auxiliary Carry (AC), Parity (P), and Carry (CY). Comprehensive Memory Interface: A virtual 64KB memory space with tools for manual data entry, memory examination, and hex file loading. Dual Execution Modes:Step Mode: Execute programs instruction-by-instruction for precise debugging. Run Mode: Automated execution with a simulated internal clock. Execution Trace Log: A dedicated log window that records every executed opcode and provides status messages.

Architecture OverviewThe project is built with a strictly decoupled architecture to ensure technical accuracy and modularity:assembler: Handles the lexical analysis and binary encoding of assembly instructions. cpu: Defines the physical hardware state, including registers and flag-packing logic (PSW). execution: The instruction engine that simulates the ALU and control unit logic. memory: Simulates the system's RAM and provides byte-level access controls. gui_main: A centralized dashboard that synchronizes the hardware state with the visual interface.

Technical DetailsRegister Pair LogicThe simulator accurately mimics the 8085's ability to use 8-bit registers in pairs (BC, DE, HL) to store 16-bit addresses using bitwise shifting: ((H & 0xFF) << 8) | (L & 0xFF); Flag Register (PSW)Status flags are managed as individual booleans and packed into the Program Status Word (PSW) following the hardware-defined bit-mapping of the 8085.

Getting StartedPrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.Installation & RunCompile all modules:Bashjavac -cp . .java gui_main/.java assembler/.java cpu/.java execution/.java memory/.java Launch the application:Bashjava -cp . gui_main.MainFrame Programming ExampleLoad this into the simulator to test basic arithmetic and memory storage:Code snippetMVI A, 0AH ; Load 10 (decimal) into Accumulator

MVI B, 05H ; Load 5 into Register B

ADD B ; A = A + B (Result: 0FH)

STA 2050H ; Store result in memory address 2050H

HLT ; Stop execution
